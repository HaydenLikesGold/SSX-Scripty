# SSX-Scripty
Scripts to ease personal development

##Usage
For my personal projects, I create a folder that I include in the `.gitignore`, this is where I placed any of the SSX-Scripty files I wish to use. To run the script simply execute:
`source .scripty {argument}`

The argument can be a range of different commands, but will always include an `init`, which is simple setup for the given type of project.

For me, I like to give it a little extra flair, and made a simple alias to reference SSX. I added `alias ssx="source"` to my `.zshrc` file (utilizing oh-my-zsh) so that command go as follows:
`ssx .scripty {argument}`

A minor difference, but makes the snowboarding reference complete.
